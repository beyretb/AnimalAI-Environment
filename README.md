# AnimalAI-Environment
This folder contains the source code for the [Animal-AI Olympics](https://github.com/beyretb/AnimalAI-Olympics) 
evaluation environment. It is built on top of the [ML-Agents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents) Unity SDK (v0.7). If you are new to Unity and ML-Agents, you can find their documentation [here](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/tree/master/docs)

The project contains all the assets needed to build the executable environment used for training and evaluation. Most of the 
original code from Unity has been left unchanged, we added some parts and modified some others. Almost all of the 
Animal-AI-specific code is located in `Assets/AnimalAIOlympics/TrainEnv/` (except for the protobuf definitions and lights off).

We decided to release the environment a month into the competition following popular demand, and we are excited to see what great techniques can come 
from this. Please note that due to our very limited resources we will focus on supporting the 
[Animal-AI Olympics competition](https://github.com/beyretb/AnimalAI-Olympics) itself, but not this repo (until the end of the 
competition).

Good luck!
